# Tetris

Run the play.rb file from the terminal to watch the computer play tetris. 
At the beginning of each turn, a piece is chosen at random. For the sake of simplicity (at least for now), 
the only Piece classes used are Block (2x2) and Rod (4x1). Members of the Piece class are able to rotate, 
however the computer doesn't take advantage of this.
